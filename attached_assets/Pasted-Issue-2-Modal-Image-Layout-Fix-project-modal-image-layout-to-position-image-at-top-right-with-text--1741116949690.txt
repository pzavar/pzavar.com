Issue 2: Modal Image Layout
Fix project modal image layout to position image at top right with text wrapping around.
HTML Changes (for EngageAI modal as example):
htmlCopy<div class="modal-content p-6">
  <div class="relative mb-6">
    <!-- Project image floating at top right -->
    <div class="float-right ml-4 mb-4 w-1/4 md:w-1/5 lg:w-1/4">
      <img src="engageai.png" alt="EngageAI" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    </div>
    
    <!-- Full-width text content that wraps around the image -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-3">Project Overview</h4>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      We designed our web app frontend to simply take a recorded lecture video as input, and to
      generate in under a minute a modern analytics dashboard with various engagement summaries
      and graphs, available for download to review offline later as needed. This dashboard serves as a
      guide for instructors to pinpoint peaks and dips in engagement levels, and better understand
      which parts of the lecture were successful and which might need improvement.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      The app is secure, self-contained, and does not expose our API. We do not store any student info, 
      and after each session the lecture video that is uploaded by an instructor and any analysis generated 
      using the video is wiped from our system, leaving us safe from most cyber attacks.
    </p>
    <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 justify-center mb-4">
      <a href="https://github.com/EphremTil17/emotion_recognition/tree/main" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Try it today!</a>
      <a href="attached_assets/MSIS 522 - Project Technical Report.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">View Technical Report</a>
    </div>
    <!-- Clear float to ensure following content appears below both text and image -->
    <div class="clear-both"></div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <!-- Rest of your modal content -->
  </div>
</div>
