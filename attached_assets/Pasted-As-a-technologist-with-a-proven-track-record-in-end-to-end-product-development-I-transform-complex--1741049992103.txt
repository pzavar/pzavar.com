As a technologist with a proven track record in end-to-end product development, I transform complex challenges into robust solutions that help achieve business objectives. My career path from hands-on implementation consultant to team manager at FAST Enterprises, a responsibility typically reserved for more senior professionals, showcases my ability to grow quickly in Agile product development environments.
While assigned to the Iowa Department of Revenue modernization program, I managed all external agency licensing and GovConnect.Iowa.Gov, Iowa’s taxpayer portal serving 1.5 millions individuals and businesses annually for a wide array of functions. My technical and design improvements delivered measurable results, reducing processing times and cutting customer abandonment rates by over 20% for the two most frequently used web requests while integrating an identity verification API to speed up processing times by 2 days. 
I thrive in collaborative environments where I can build meaningful relationships with colleagues and clients. My approach centers on establishing trust through honesty and accountability, consistently taking ownership of challenges while empowering those around me. I'm not content with "how things have always been done"—I actively seek opportunities to innovate, introduce new tools, and challenge conventional thinking. My growth mindset makes me receptive to feedback, allowing me to continuously improve while having the courage to navigate difficult conversations when necessary to move projects forward.
I am currently pursuing my MS in Information Systems at the University of Washington, Michael G. Foster School of Business, and I’m exploring cutting-edge areas including AI, advanced data mining, cybersecurity, and organizational management. This academic work enhances my practical experience, positioning me to solve complex problems at the intersection of technology and business. Previously, I obtained my BS in Computer Science from UCLA. 
My passion is creating robust technical solutions that address critical customer challenges—whether through collaborative work as a solutions engineer or by developing transformative products with widespread impact. As I approach graduation in June 2025, I'm seeking Product Manager or Solutions Engineer roles where I can apply my unique combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and user-centered design.
